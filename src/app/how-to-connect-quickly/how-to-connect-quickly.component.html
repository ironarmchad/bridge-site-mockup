      <h3>Starting Point</h3>

      <p>
        Starting Point is a relaxed two-week study that will open the doors to our mission, strategy, beliefs and
        goals for your future here at Bridge Christian Church. The class concludes with an introduction to Connect
        Groups, Life Groups, ministry opportunities and lunch with the ministry staff.  Starting Point meets every
        other month in meeting room A during the 11:15am worship service and is led by a Bridge staff member. To

      <h3>Connect Groups</h3>

      <p>
        Connect Groups are where you can get to know others in the church that have similar interests, pastimes, or
        hobbies, and have fun at the same time! If you arenâ€™t ready to join a Life Group or Bible study, try a Connect
        Group. Check out the Connect Group page for more details.
